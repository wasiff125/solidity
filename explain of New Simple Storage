solidity
Copy code
pragma solidity 0.8.18;
This specifies the version of the Solidity compiler to be used (0.8.18 in this case). Solidity is the programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
solidity
Copy code
import {SimpleStorage} from "./SimpleStorage.sol";
This line imports the SimpleStorage contract from the file SimpleStorage.sol. It allows the StorageFactory contract to interact with the SimpleStorage contract.
solidity
Copy code
contract StorageFactory {
This line starts the declaration of a new contract called StorageFactory. A contract in Solidity is similar to a class in object-oriented programming.
solidity
Copy code
    SimpleStorage[] public listOfSimpleStorage;
This line declares a public dynamic array of type SimpleStorage. It will store instances of the SimpleStorage contract that will be created later.
solidity
Copy code
    function createSimpleStorgaeContract() public {
This line declares a function named createSimpleStorgaeContract, which is publicly accessible (the public keyword). This function is used to create a new instance of the SimpleStorage contract.
solidity
Copy code
        SimpleStorage newSimpleStorageContract = new SimpleStorage();
This line creates a new instance of the SimpleStorage contract and assigns it to the variable newSimpleStorageContract. It effectively deploys a new instance of the SimpleStorage contract on the blockchain.
solidity
Copy code
        listOfSimpleStorage.push(newSimpleStorageContract);
This line adds the newly created SimpleStorage contract instance to the listOfSimpleStorage array, so it can be accessed later.
solidity
Copy code
    function sfStore(uint _simpleStorageIndex, uint _newSimpleStorageNumber) public {
This line declares a function named sfStore, which is publicly accessible. It is used to store a value in a specific SimpleStorage contract instance.
solidity
Copy code
        SimpleStorage mySimpleStorage = listOfSimpleStorage[_simpleStorageIndex];
This line declares a variable mySimpleStorage of type SimpleStorage and assigns it the value of a specific SimpleStorage contract instance from the listOfSimpleStorage array. The contract instance is selected using the _simpleStorageIndex parameter.
solidity
Copy code
        mySimpleStorage.store(_newSimpleStorageNumber);
This line calls the store function of the selected SimpleStorage contract instance and passes _newSimpleStorageNumber as an argument. This will store the provided number in the SimpleStorage contract.
solidity
Copy code
    function sfGet(uint _simpleStorageIndex) public view returns (uint256) {
This line declares a function named sfGet, which is publicly accessible. It is used to retrieve a value from a specific SimpleStorage contract instance.
solidity
Copy code
        SimpleStorage mySimpleStorage = listOfSimpleStorage[_simpleStorageIndex];
This line declares a variable mySimpleStorage of type SimpleStorage and assigns it the value of a specific SimpleStorage contract instance from the listOfSimpleStorage array. The contract instance is selected using the _simpleStorageIndex parameter.
solidity
Copy code
        return mySimpleStorage.retrieve();
This line returns the result of calling the retrieve function of the selected SimpleStorage contract instance. It will fetch and return the stored value from the SimpleStorage contract.
solidity
Copy code
}
This line marks the end of the StorageFactory contract. The contract includes functions to create new SimpleStorage contracts and interact with them by storing and retrieving values.
